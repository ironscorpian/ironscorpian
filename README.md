Currently studying computer science as well as other courses on the side and this is where I'm going to upload a ton of practice exercises and a bunch of projects and some random stuff that I am working on. So this whole github page is a learning journey for me.

Also a big keyboard connoisseur so I might upload some future keyboard PCB designs and some 3D prints when I have the time to work on them.
